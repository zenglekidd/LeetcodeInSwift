/*
 20. Valid Parentheses
 Easy

 Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

 An input string is valid if:

 Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
 Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
 Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

 Example 1:
 Input: "()"
 Output: true
 
 Example 2:
 Input: "()[]{}"
 Output: true
 
 Example 3:
 Input: "(]"
 Output: false
 
 Example 4:
 Input: "([)]"
 Output: false
 
 Example 5:
 Input: "{[]}"
 Output: true
